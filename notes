Resize Images:

Resize images to a consistent size. Many deep learning models require input images to have the same dimensions.
 You can use libraries like OpenCV or Pillow for resizing.
 
 Normalize Pixel Values:

Normalize pixel values to a specific range (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]). This helps the model converge faster during training	
Grayscale Conversion:

Convert images to grayscale if color information is not essential for your task.
Data Augmentation:

Apply data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase the diversity of your training data. This helps the model generalize better.

Histogram Equalization:

Enhance the contrast of images using histogram equalization.

=========

This code essentially trains a PyTorch model for 50 epochs using the AdamW optimizer, 
updating the model's parameters based on the computed gradients and minimizing the loss.
 The tqdm library is used to display a progress bar during training.
 
 
In the context of machine learning, an "epoch" is a single pass through the entire training dataset during the training of a model. In simpler terms, it means the model has seen and learned from every example in the training data once.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Epoch:

An epoch consists of one forward pass (feeding input through the model to get predictions) and one backward pass (updating model parameters based on the computed gradients) for each example in the training dataset.
After completing one epoch, the model has been exposed to the entire training dataset, and its parameters have been adjusted to better fit the data.
Impact of Number of Epochs:

The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that you can set before training. It determines how many times the model will go through the entire training dataset.
If you use too few epochs, the model may not have enough opportunities to learn from the data, resulting in underfitting (poor performance on both the training and unseen data).
On the other hand, using too many epochs can lead to overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on new, unseen data.
Typically, you monitor the model's performance on a validation dataset and stop training when the performance stops improving or even degrades. This prevents overfitting and saves computational resources.
